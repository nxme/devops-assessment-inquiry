# DevOps Assessment Inquiry
This is a list of questions and checklists to verify that the application infrastructure is healthy and fulfills scalability, monitoring, notifications, logging, backups, replication, disaster recovery, load balancing, high availability.

1. Is Slave Replication being used for the master SQL Server database? If yes, what is the current setup being used?

2. Is a load balancer being used? How many load balancers?

3. Is failover provided to a passive load balancer?

4. What type of load balancer is being used?

5. Which load balancing scheme is being used (eg. Round Robin, Sticky Session)

6. How many web server machines are being load balanced?

7. How do you guarantee sessions availability during load balancing between multiple machines? Where is session data stored (eg. SQLServer, Redis, CouchBase ) ?

8. Where are log files stored (eg. raw log files, syslog, database or forwarded to a log management tool like splunk?)

9. Once an error takes place in the application log file, does the Al-Elm DevOps team get notified? How does it get notified?

10. What type of monitoring system are you using?

11. Is Apache Camel used as a single instance or do you provide clustering several instances? (To avoid Single Point of Failure)

12. What happens when external services (eg. SADAD, Yesser) become unreachable or go down? Does it get queued, or does an error message get returned to the user?

13. When an external web service is down how does the application avoid flooding connection requests to the web service? (eg. Circuit Breakers, Semaphores, etc)

14. Do you have a backup procedure to backup the Database and external related uploaded files together? Currently, only the database backup is being received?

15. Incase of a disaster incidence to the database and all it's slaves, what is the disaster RPO (Recovery Point Objective), how much data is lost when recovering (eg. Last 4 hours of data, last 7 days, last 3 days). How frequently is the data being backed
up?

16. Where are backups stored?

17. What is the backup retention policy used?

18. Are the backups replicated outside the data center?

19. How are deployments and upgrades automated? Is a CI script or solution being used?

20. Are development and debug flags turned off on production? How is this guaranteed? Is it guaranteed?

21. What are the Login Session Idle Timeout for users set after which they are forced to logout (eg. 4 hours)?

22. What are the Login Session Absolute Timeout used for users?

23. Are users forced to re-authenticate their login to change their password?

24. Which Operating System are you using on production servers?

25. What are the CPU and RAM specs for the web server machines?

26. What are the CPU and RAM specs for the database machine?

27. What are the CPU and RAM specs for the load balancer?

28. What are the CPU and RAM specs for the middle-tier (eg. Apache Camel) machines?

29. How is Business Intelligence provided through the application without breaching sensitive data such as mobile numbers, Civil IDs, full names?
